Introduction
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher algorithm to encode and decode messages. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encoding: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting letters.
Decoding: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface for encoding and decoding messages.
